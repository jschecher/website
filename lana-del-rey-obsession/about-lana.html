<p>Lana Del Rey was born in Lake Placid under the name Lizzy Grant, which she changed as she began to discover her music identity. Her parents were both wealthy entrepreneurs who supported her musical career from the beginning. Her success began as a self-made singer, who produced her own music videos and made a name for herself through her whimsical voice and powerful lyrics. Growing up, Lana was never one to conform to rules or school, and was a born rebellion. This spirit is show throughout her music, and is another attribute to her personality that catches her fans&rsquo; attention. Her music interest began when her uncle taught her how to play guitar growing up. It wasn&rsquo;t until 2005 when she attended college at Fordham University when she became serious about her talents and how far she can really take them. She released her first music video on YouTube by creating it herself on her MacBook, She was able to catch the attention of two managers, Ben Mawson and Ed Millett, who branded her name and her image. Eventually she was signed to Stranger Records and released multiple singles which escalated to the top of the charts in the UK. Today, she has released 12 albums, 5 of them reaching top of the charts with popularity in the US and the UK. She has toured the world and is continuing to do so to satisfy her fans with her dreamy performance. </p>
