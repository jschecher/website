  <p>Among being a wife to Kim Kardashian, father, and public figure, Kanye West began rapping at a very young age and has evolved into the talk of the rap industry ever since he showed the world his talents. He is known for more than just rapping, but making very public opinons on a variety of issues. Lately, I have been listening to his new album, Life of Pablo. This album graced Billboard's charts and caused contraversy due to the racey lyrics that is displayed. </p>
