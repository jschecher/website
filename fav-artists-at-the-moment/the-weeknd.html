<p>This past November, my friends and I went to see The Weeknd in concert. For months leading up to this concert, we would blast his music on repeat, so when we found out he was coming to Brooklyn there was no hesitance to buy tickets. The concert was amazing, he truly lived up to his expectation. He satisfied the need to hear instruments, lyrics and to visualize dancing. The crowd never sat down and I was constantly entertained and never bored. This concert was one of the best concerts I have ever been to, and The weeknd is a force to be reckoned with. </p>

<p>The Weeknd is a singer/ songwriter who sings R&amp;B. He is a Grammy nominee and winner, and came onto the music scene in a somewhat recent series of events. Originally from Canada, he grew up idolzing Michaell Jackson and has said in interviews that he found his voice through Michael's music. He first started releasing his music in 2012 and has become a hit ever since. Now, in 2016, he has collabrated with artists such as Beyonce, recently wrapped up his own tour and is joining Rihanna on her highly anticiapted tour. He is a popular, sought after aritist that graces any stage he walks on. </p>
