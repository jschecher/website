<p>Selena Gomez is definintly one of my favorite artist at the moment. Although I have never been to her concert, I listen to her album frequently and keep up with her life through social media. I have always admired Selena because of her spirituality and individuality. She is the type of celebrity that is not afraid to be imperfect, and she accepts her flaws with grace. Ontop of her amazing vocal talent, her latest album, &quot;Revival&quot; proves that she is matured into a woman and she has music to prove it. Although constantly in the news for her old flame Justin Bieber, she deals with publicity in a kind matter and is always honest with her fans through her social media posts. She is elegant and beautfiul and her music matches her personality. </p>

  <p>Selena Gomez and I share the same birthday, July 22, which is also a reason I love her so much. She was a child star on Barney and progressed onto Disney Channel where she starred in her own show, Wizards of Waverly Place. From that show, she branched out of the acting industry and into music where she found her true talent and passion. Since then, she has excelled and has released four albums which have climbed to the top of the charts. Her fan base has grown excessively and helps her carry the musical presense she holds. </p>
