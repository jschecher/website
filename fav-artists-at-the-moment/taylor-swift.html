  <p>I have seen Taylor Swift twice in concert, each time getting better and better. I was fortunate enough to witness her early on in her career, at her Fearless concert, which is to date one of her most popular albums. Since then, the world has been watching Taylor evolve into a music icon with a particular idenitity that is hard to miss. Starting from a country singer with nothing but a guitar and a talent, and evolving into a pop sensation with an entire team of musical guidance behind her, she has been truthful and honest every step of her process. I attended her most recent concert in the summer, and it was an unbelivable display of dancing, singing, inspiration and talent combined into onto one stage. 1989 is the name of her most recent album and is a mix of pop and her classic lyrics defining love, heartbreak and everything in between. </p>

  <p>Taylor Swift was born in Pennsylvania, but moved to Tennesse when she was only 14 to pursue her musical dreams. Taylor started off being a country singer, and evolved over the years into Pop music. Since she was signed to Big Machine Records, she has been making history as a young singer in the industry. In 2008, Taylor was the highest selling country artist of that year. She has won 270 awards in genreal, 24 of those are Grammy Awards. Recently, Taylor has even been named after an award given by BMI Pop Awards, the second person in history to have this honor after Michael Jackson in 1990. From the start, Taylor has grabbed her fan's attention and started an extreme following from people of all ages. From her concerts to her songs, she is truly a sensation that the world will never forget. </p>
