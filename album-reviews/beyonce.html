  <p>Beyonce is known for releasing amazing music, and if you say otherwise her fan base will most likely attack you (through the internet of course). It was not to my surpise when the world spun out of control when her new album was dropped, and it definently was not to my surprise when it recieved the amazing reviews that it did. Now don't get me wrong, I respect Beyonce and her musical talents. I think she is one of the most talented female artist of our time, and will remain that way throughout history. Lemonade is probably one of my favorite albums from her, but I was not as blown away as everyone else was. Yes, it was a very well made album with different tones of music incooperated to create a genius record. This record rotates around her marriage with rapper husband Jay-Z and this was displayed when she released a virtual album with the album itself. An hour long artistic movie, Beyonce is shown in a variety of different scenes singing lines from the album, which caused an up roar from her fans. She depicted her husband to have cheated on her, nearly broke the internet, then went on tour. Genius. The album overall is very good, but there are some songs that I dislike. </p>
